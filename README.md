# Snake Game
## Based on Youtube Tutorial by thenewboston

### Project Description: A simple snake game made using pygame. 

- Personal project
I started this project to learn pygame. Most of the codes are based on the Youtube Tutorial, but I reorganized codes to improve readability. 

- To run the project:
1. Downdown this repository into your computer
2. Make sure pygame is installed in your computer. If not follow the instruction in the following link: https://pygame.pfaj.ca/
3. Run the file called snake_game_cleaned_up_version using IDE of your choice.


Have fun! :smiley:
